Just a smart greenhouse that uses ML models to predict the type of crop that can be grown in the soil as well as predict crop parameters based on the input crop. Uses simple streamlit for the frontend. Was planning to integrate it with hardware that can control the soil parameters, but that future work. For now, the website can use the models to predict.
Please place the models folder in the same directory as the other files.
Run flaskserver.py
Run frontend.py
Open the website and enjoy!
